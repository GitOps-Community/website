## TL;DR

If you’re here, you might be looking for the [GitOps Days 2020 YouTube Playlist of talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lTuCFNLaD2NiNrdt7SaQjpYx_m37czS)! 

We also have the conversation kit, a topic-based guide to the videos and, in the future, will point to more resources such as blog posts, tutorials, etc.


### v.1 GitOps Conversation Kit (released May 28, 2020)

We hope that this kit will provide you with the quotes, use cases, customer stories, training materials, and more to move the needle with GitOps in your organization - with leadership, stakeholders, and dev and platform teams. 

This is a living kit that we will improve with your feedback with future versions.
